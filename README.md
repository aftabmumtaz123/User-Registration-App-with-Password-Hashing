## User Registration App with Password Hashing (aftabmumtaz123)

**Description:**

This Node.js application demonstrates basic user registration with password hashing using Express, EJS, and Mongoose. It allows users to submit their name, email, and password, which is securely hashed before storing it in a database.

**Note:** This is a simplified example and doesn't include complete authentication functionalities like login or session management.

**Features:**

- **User Registration:** Users can submit their information through a form.
- **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt before saving to the database, protecting user data.
- **Mongoose Integration:** Mongoose acts as an object data modeling (ODM) layer for interacting with a MongoDB database (not included in this example).
- **EJS Templating:** EJS templates render dynamic content on the pages.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A MongoDB database instance running (optional - for full functionality).

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aftabmumtaz123/User-Registration-App-with-Password-Hashing.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd user-registration-app
   npm install express bcryptjs mongoose
   ```

   **Note:** You might need to install additional packages for database connection (e.g., `mongodb` driver) depending on your setup.

**Configuration (Optional - Database):**

1. **Create a `.env` file (optional):**

   If you're using a MongoDB database, create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with the following line (replace `YOUR_MONGO_URI` with your actual MongoDB connection string):

   ```
   MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGO_URI
   ```

   Make sure you don't commit the `.env` file to your GitHub repository.

2. **Configure MongoDB connection (if not using `.env`):**

   Modify the code to connect to your MongoDB database directly (not recommended for production as it exposes sensitive information).

**Usage (Assuming no database connection):**

1. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server on port `3001` by default. You can access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3001/.

2. **Register a user:**

   - Visit the app in your browser.
   - Fill in the registration form with your desired name, email, and password.
   - Submit the form.

   **Note:** In this simplified setup, no user data is actually stored as there's no database connection. However, you'll see a success message if the form submission is successful.

**Further Development:**

- Set up a MongoDB database connection to persist user data.
- Implement authentication features like login and session management.
- Add validation for user input (e.g., email format, password strength).
- Improve error handling and provide more informative messages to the user.

**License:**

(Consider adding a license to your project, such as MIT or Apache. This helps clarify how others can use and distribute your code.)

**Security Considerations:**

- This is a simplified example and may not be suitable for production use without further security measures.
- Storing passwords securely is crucial. Implement proper hashing techniques like bcrypt to protect user data.
- Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., connection strings) directly in your code. Consider using environment variables or configuration files.

I hope this enhanced README provides clear instructions and valuable information for anyone using my user registration app!
